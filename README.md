# Azure-Sentinel-lab

This project used Microsoft Azure which is an online computing platform that offers analytic tools which allows Users to protect themselves from the Internet of Things. This tool can be used for Security information and event management (SIEM) for all logins. 

## How It Works

The software allows me to create a virtual machine that mimics a clean installation of any Operating System and record user access. When I turn off the innate Firewall and put this vunerable system to the public I can record which bad actor tries to connect to my account. Malicious actors try to brute force into my Virtual machine by guessing the username and password.
